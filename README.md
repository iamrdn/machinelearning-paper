# Machine learning paper

Beginner friendly paper for machine learning. From decision tree, ensembling learning to optimizing methods. 
Most of the included papers cover the basics and intermediate advanced topics of machine learning / deep learning 
and are therefore recommended for beginners. Some of them are pretty hard to understand, but are also included for the sake 
of completeness.

# My recommendations

Following are researchs you should read if you want to dive diver into this field

## Activation functions

* Activation functions: comparision of trends in practice and research for deep learning

This research will show you the definition of activation functions and also the most famous ones in modern deep learning. 

## Backpropagation

* Backpropagation neural network

A great paper about how neural networks correct its weights depending on its outputs. Very well explained with examples 
of how popular activation functions can be derivated for backpropagation purpose.

## Recommender system

* Matrix Factorization techniques for recommender systems

Despite the title, this paper is rather an overview than a technical paper on how matrix factorization helps netflix to keep its users online. Still very interesting read.
